        <p>Lets kick things off with our strong and reliable John the man who has made this entire thing possible, without John I doubt we could've made it this far. He's  the one who everyone turns to when they are stuck or need help with something, he is constantly keeping all of us up to date and in the loop with how our project is looking what we should add, what we should improve upon, and how he can help as well. If you ask him he'll deny it but I know he's had to have lost some hair trying to get everyhting to work properly and for that the whole team is grateful. Here are some words from John. "Hi! My name is John Nguyen and I am an aspiring software developer. I was originally a behavioral specialist but I have found a greater passion in coding. I am currently studying under Digital Crafts coding bootcamp. If you have any questions about the site then please feel free to contact me. I currently run the social media and email of this site. I look forward to any feedback and updating the site. This is my first CS project as a group and I hope you all enjoy."</p>
