Project Description/Project Goal : This website is a page inspired by BuzzFeed. After doing some research we realized it was so successful because it was very niche. We wanted to create a page that was similar but for music lover. A place for music lovers to go to in order to pass time. 

Technology used: 

Our project leverages Spotify's API to fetch the necessary data for display on our webpage. To enhance the user experience, we utilized HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling elements. On the backend, we employed JavaScript as the primary programming language.
